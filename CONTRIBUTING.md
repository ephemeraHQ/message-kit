## Developing

#### Node

Please make sure you have a compatible version as specified in `package.json`. We recommend using a Node version manager such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv).

#### Yarn

This repository uses the [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/). To use it, enable [Corepack](https://yarnpkg.com/corepack), if it isn't already, by running `corepack enable`.

Useful scripts:

- `yarn`: Installs all dependencies
- `yarn build`: Builds templates and `packages/message-kit`
- `yarn clean`: Remove all¬†`node_modules`,¬†`.turbo`, and build folders, clears Yarn cache
- `yarn format`: Run prettier format and write changes on all packages
- `yarn format:check`: Run prettier format check on all packages
- `yarn typecheck`: Typecheck all packages
