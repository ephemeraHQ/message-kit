## 🔀 Pull requests

PRs are encouraged, but consider starting with a feature request to temperature-check first. If the PR involves a major change to the protocol, the work should be fleshed out as an [XMTP Improvement Proposal](https://community.xmtp.org/t/xip-0-xip-purpose-process-guidelines/475) before work begins.

After a pull request is submitted, a single approval is required to merge it.

## 🔧 Developing

### Prerequisites

#### Node

Please make sure you have a compatible version as specified in `package.json`. We recommend using a Node version manager such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv).

#### Yarn

This repository uses the [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/). To use it, enable [Corepack](https://yarnpkg.com/corepack), if it isn't already, by running `corepack enable`.

### Useful commands

- `yarn`: Installs all dependencies
- `yarn build`: Builds the examples and `packages/botkit`
- `yarn clean`: Remove all `node_modules`, `.turbo`, and build folders, clears Yarn cache
- `yarn format`: Run prettier format and write changes on all packages
- `yarn format:check`: Run prettier format check on all packages
- `yarn typecheck`: Typecheck all packages
