# Structure

A general overview of the structure of a Bot:

### File structure

```
bot-project/         # Optional middleware files
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts         # Entry point for your bot. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│   ├── commands.ts      # Commands for your bot. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
├── tsconfig.json         // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
├── package.json         // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
└── .env               # Environment variables
```

### `index.ts`

The `index.ts` file is the entry point for your bot. It should contain something like the following:

```jsx
import "dotenv/config";
import { run, HandlerContext } from "@xmtp/botkit";

run(async (context: HandlerContext) => {
  // Get the message and the address from the sender
  const { content, senderAddress } = context.message;

  // To reply, just call `reply` on the HandlerContext.
  await context.reply(`gm`);
});
```

### Commands

Each bot can have a `commands.ts` file that contains the commands that the bot can execute. The commands are defined as an array of objects with the following keys:

```json
export const commands = [
  {
    command: "/help",
    description: "Get help with the bot.",
  },
];
```

### Environment variables

Each bot should have an `.env` file that contains the following:

```bash
KEY= # 0x... the private key of the bot (with the 0x prefix)
XMTP_ENV=production # or `dev`
```
