# XMTP

**XMTP** is an open-source messaging protocol that uses **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)** across a decentralized network. It protects messages through their entire lifecycle (including at rest) and hides metadata from unauthorized parties. Via a **decentralized network**, XMTP rewards node operators and fosters network growth. Its open, interoperable design also simplifies developer integrations across AI, Web3, and enterprise environments.

### Privacy

XMTP provides end-to-end encryption to ensure private and secure communications.

- **End-to-end**: Servers only see cipher text, preventing data exfiltration through server breaches or insider threats.
- **Trustless**: Traditional TLS depends on certificate providers for trust. XMTP avoids single points of failure by leveraging mathematics.
- **Ephemeral identities**: Users can remain pseudonymous, minimizing data collection while still enabling secure conversations.
- **Metadata protection**: Prevents tracking of additional data like timestamps and message routes, IP, location or device
- **Compliant**: Enterprise regulations increasingly require that sensitive data be inaccessible to employees or intermediaries, something **server-level TLS** cannot guarantee.

### Decentralized network

XMTP runs on a network enabling peer-to-peer messaging without relying on central servers.

- **Decentralized**: Node operators can form decentralized networks.
- **Permissionless**: Anyone can participate from the network just following simple instructions.
- **Transparency**: All the data from the network is available to see via the nodes exposing its true secure and private nature.
- **Identity**: Agents can automatically verify counterparties using on-chain or decentralized identifiers like ENS
- **Open-source**: Easier customization and audibility, with community-driven improvements.
- **Cross-platform**: XMTP-based communications can flow across different frontends, backends (multiple SDKs), and AI agent architectures.

### Security

XMTP is built on the IETF-standard [Messaging Layer Security (MLS)](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/) protocol – the same open-source security foundation trusted by Mozilla, Google, Wire, and Cisco.

- **Post-compromise**: XMTP offers stronger protection than TLS by using per-message ephemeral keys (ensuring that if a key is compromised, old messages remain safe) and continuous key rotation (so future messages remain secure even if someone gains access to a current key).

Not using E2EE may exposed multi-agentic systems to the following threats:

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks**
- **Data leakage**
- **Insider threats**
