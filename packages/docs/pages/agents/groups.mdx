# Groups

MessageKit allows agents to interact inside XMTP groups. Make sure you follow the [guidelines](/agents/guidelines) for building responsible group agents on XMTP.

:::info
You need to **add the agent to the group as a member**.
:::

## Overview

### Create a group

To create a group from your agent, you can use the following code:

```tsx
const group = await client?.conversations.newGroup([address1, address2]);
```

### Manage members

As an admin you can add members to the group.

```tsx
// get the group
const { group } = context;
await group.sync();
//By address
await group.addMembers([userAddresses]);
//By inboxId
await group.addMembersByInboxId([addedInboxes]);
```

:::details[Reference implementation]

These are some example methods for creating and managing groups for ensuring reliability and security.

### Remove from group

```tsx
export async function removeFromGroup(
  groupId: string,
  client: Client,
  senderAddress: string,
): Promise<{ code: number; message: string }> {
  try {
    let lowerAddress = senderAddress.toLowerCase();
    const isOnXMTP = await client.canMessage([lowerAddress]);
    if (!isOnXMTP)
      return {
        code: 400,
        message: "You don't seem to have a XMTP identity ",
      };
    const conversation =
      await client.conversations.getConversationById(groupId);
    console.warn("removing from group", conversation?.id);
    await conversation?.sync();
    await conversation?.removeMembers([lowerAddress]);
    console.warn("Removed member from group");
    await conversation?.sync();
    const members = await conversation?.members();
    console.warn("Number of members", members?.length);

    let wasRemoved = true;
    if (members) {
      for (const member of members) {
        let lowerMemberAddress = member.accountAddresses[0].toLowerCase();
        if (lowerMemberAddress === lowerAddress) {
          wasRemoved = false;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    return {
      code: wasRemoved ? 200 : 400,
      message: wasRemoved
        ? "You have been removed from the group"
        : "Failed to remove from group",
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error removing from group", error);
    return {
      code: 400,
      message: "Failed to remove from group",
    };
  }
}
```

### Add to group

```tsx
export async function addToGroup(
  groupId: string,
  client: Client,
  address: string,
  asAdmin: boolean = false,
): Promise<{ code: number; message: string }> {
  try {
    let lowerAddress = address.toLowerCase();
    const isOnXMTP = await client.canMessage([lowerAddress]);
    if (!isOnXMTP)
      return {
        code: 400,
        message: "You don't seem to have a XMTP identity ",
      };
    const group = await client.conversations.getConversationById(groupId);
    console.warn("Adding to group", group?.id);
    await group?.sync();
    await group?.addMembers([lowerAddress]);
    console.warn("Added member to group");
    await group?.sync();
    if (asAdmin) {
      await group?.addSuperAdmin(lowerAddress);
    }
    const members = await group?.members();
    console.warn("Number of members", members?.length);

    if (members) {
      for (const member of members) {
        let lowerMemberAddress = member.accountAddresses[0].toLowerCase();
        if (lowerMemberAddress === lowerAddress) {
          console.warn("Member exists", lowerMemberAddress);
          return {
            code: 200,
            message: "You have been added to the group",
          };
        }
      }
    }
    return {
      code: 400,
      message: "Failed to add to group",
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      code: 400,
      message: "Failed to add to group",
    };
  }
}
```

### Added member event

When a member is added to a group it will emit a `group_updated` event with a `addedInboxes` array containing the addresses of the users added.

```tsx
if (typeId === "group_updated") {
  const { addedInboxes } = context.message.content;

  if (addedInboxes?.length > 0) {
    for (const inbox of addedInboxes) {
      console.log(`User added: ${inbox.inboxId}`);
    }
  }
}
```
