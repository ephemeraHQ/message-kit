**Summary of Changes**

The pull request introduces several updates and improvements across multiple files in the project:

- **Template Renaming**: The `gm` template has been renamed to `gpt` throughout the codebase. This reflects a shift to using GPT-based agents for more advanced interactions.

- **Prompt Enhancements**: Agent prompt functions have been updated to use a simplified and more effective prompt generation method. The prompts now leverage a `defaultPromptTemplate`, improving the way agents generate and handle prompts for GPT-based models.

- **Skill Definitions Updates**: Skill definitions in `skills.ts` files have been modified. The `triggers` property has been removed from skill objects, and parameters have been updated to enhance skill parsing and execution.

- **New Test Suites**: New test files have been added to improve testing coverage for agents and skill parsing. These include tests for agent prompting, skill parsing, and group interactions.

- **Codebase Cleanup**: Outdated files and templates, such as the old `gm` template and middleware files, have been removed to streamline the codebase and reduce clutter.

- **Documentation Updates**: Documentation has been extensively updated to reflect all changes. This includes updates to READMEs, code examples, tutorial guides, and the AI Skills framework documentation.

- **Dependency and Configuration Updates**: Several dependencies have been updated to newer versions, and configurations like package versions and build scripts have been adjusted accordingly.

- **Improvements in Handlers and Skills**: Handler functions have been refined for better error handling and functionality, particularly in agent and group templates.

- **User Information Resolution**: Enhancements have been made to how user information is resolved and cached, improving efficiency and consistency when retrieving user data like ENS domains and addresses.

Overall, these changes aim to enhance the functionality of GPT-based agents, improve code quality, update documentation for better developer experience, and streamline the project structure.
