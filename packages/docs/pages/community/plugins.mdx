Plugins are the building blocks of MessageKit agents.

:::steps

#### Test it

Make it work in the playground:

```bash
message-kit/
└── templates/
    └── playground/
        ├── plugins/ # Optional
        │   ├── other plugins...
        │   └── your-plugin.ts
        ├── skills/ # Optional
        │   ├── other skills...
        │   └── your-skill.ts
        ├── package.json
        └── README.md
```

Run it:

```bash
yarn dev:play
```

> ⚠️ Feel free to edit the `index.ts` file but don't remove the existing skills.

#### Create the docs

- Add the Doc file to the [plugins](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/message-kit/tree/main/packages/docs/pages/plugins) folder

#### Update the community file

- Update the [`community/plugins.json`](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/message-kit/tree/main/community/plugins.json) file to include your new plugin.
