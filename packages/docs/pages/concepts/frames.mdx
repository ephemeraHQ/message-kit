# Frames

FrameKit allows you to generate frames from your backend agent. Here are some practical examples of how to implement different types of frames.

## Payment

You can request payments using the payment frame:

```typescript
// Request 1 USDC payment to a specific address
await context.requestPayment(1, "USDC", recipientAddress);
```

Properties:

- `amount`: Number representing the payment amount
- `token`: Supported tokens include "eth", "dai", "usdc", "degen"
- `address`: Recipient's wallet address or ENS name

## Transaction Receipts

You can request receipts using the receipt frame:

```typescript
// Request a receipt
await context.sendReceipt(urlOfTransaction);
// ie https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/0x1234567890abcdef
```

Properties:

- `url`: URL of the transaction receipt scanner like basescan, etherscan, etc.

## Custom

Custom frames allow you to create interactive UI elements. Here's how to create a token price frame:

```typescript
const frame = {
  title: "Bitcoin",
  buttons: [
    { content: "Buy", action: "link", target: "https://example.com/buy" },
    {
      content: "Price ($30,000)",
      action: "link",
      target: "https://example.com/price",
    },
  ],
  image: "https://example.com/bitcoin.png",
};

await context.sendCustomFrame(frame);
```

Properties:

- `title`: The header text of your frame
- `buttons`: Array of interactive buttons (max 2)
- `image`: URL of the image to display
- `action`: Type of button action ("link" or "post")
- `target`: Destination URL for button clicks
