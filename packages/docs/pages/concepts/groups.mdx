# Groups

Included with the context you will get the `conversation` object and the `client` object.

```tsx
const { client, conversation } = context;
```

## Create a new group

Using the client you can create a new group with an array of addresses.

```tsx
const group = await client.conversations.newGroup(addresses);
```

## Sync a group

Each time you perform an action on a group you must sync it to get the latest state.

```tsx
await group.sync();
```

## Update a group name

You can update the name of the group chat.

> ðŸ”’ You need admin privileges to update the name.

```tsx
// get the name
const groupName = group.name;
// update the name
await group.updateName(name);
```

## Member management

```tsx
//By address
await group.addMembers(userAddresses);
//By inboxId
await group.addMembersByInboxId(addedInboxes);

## Messages

To get the message history in a group you can use the `messages` property.
