# Groups

MessageKit allows agents to interact inside XMTP groups.

> Make sure you follow the [guidelines](/guidelines) for building responsible group agents on XMTP.

## Tag an agent

If a message includes a tag like `@bot`, it will be received by your stream like any other message.

```tsx
export const agent: Agent = {
  name: "Web3 Domain Bot",
  tag: "@bot",
  description: "Register Web3 domains.",
  skills: [
    /*Your set of skills*/
  ],
};
```

Example:

```bash
@bot who owns vitalik.eth
```

> Be aware that you need to add the agent to the group as a member.

## Create a group

To create a group from your agent, you can use the following code:

```tsx
const group = await client?.conversations.newGroup([address1, address2]);
```

Check out the [gated group](/skills/gated) template.

## Add members

As an admin you can add members to the group.

```tsx
// get the group
const { group } = context;
await group.sync();
//By address
await group.addMembers([userAddresses]);
//By inboxId
await group.addMembersByInboxId([addedInboxes]);
```

## Added member event

When a member is added to a group it will emit a `group_updated` event with a `addedInboxes` array containing the addresses of the users added.

```tsx
if (typeId === "group_updated") {
  const { addedInboxes } = context.message.content;

  if (addedInboxes?.length > 0) {
    for (const inbox of addedInboxes) {
      console.log(`User added: ${inbox.inboxId}`);
    }
  }
}
```
