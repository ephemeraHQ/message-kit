# Prompting

Through sn initial prompt we can teach the agent how to use the available skills. With all this knowledge the agent can respond to specific use cases.

## Overview

For prompting to be effective we need to combine the following skills:

- [Processing](/concepts/skills/processing): Handle multiple skills in a single conversation.
- [Parsing](/concepts/skills/parsing): Interpret user intent and translate it into a defined skill.
- [Definition](/concepts/skills/definition): Define skills, parameters and handlers.

## System prompt

Here is the prompt for the agent.

```jsx [src/prompt.ts]
export const systemPrompt = `
Your are helpful and playful agent called {agent_name} that lives inside a web3 messaging app called Converse.

{rules}

{user_context}

{skills}

{scenarios}
`;

let prompt = await replaceVariables(systemPrompt, sender.address, skills);
```

Predefined properties:

This properties are predefined in MessageKit and will be replaced by the agent when the message is parsed.

- `{rules}`: The rules of the agent.
- `{user_context}`: The user context.
- `{skills}`: The skills of the agent.
- `{scenarios}`: The scenarios of the agent.
- `{agent_name}`: The name of the agent.
- `{name}`: The name of the user.
- `{address}`: The address of the user.
- `{domain}`: The ENS domain of the user.
- `{username}`: The Converse username of the user.

## Replace variables

This template is part of the message-kit package.

```jsx [src/helpers/gpt.ts]
// [!include ~/../../packages/message-kit/src/helpers/gpt.ts:replaceVariables]
```

## End result

The end result is a prompt that the model can understand and use to respond to the user.

```md [example_prompt.md]
// [!include ~/../../templates/agent/example_prompt.md]
```
