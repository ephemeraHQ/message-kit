# Scenarios

`Scenarios` is a technique to improve the performance of a model on a specific task. This technique can be **very** effective.

## Overview

For `Scenarios` to be effective we need to combine the following skills:

- [Prompting](/concepts/skills/prompting): System prompt to teach available skills to the agent.
- [Processing](/concepts/skills/processing): Handle multiple skills in a single conversation.
- [Parsing](/concepts/skills/parsing): Interpret user intent and translate it into a defined skill.
- [Definition](/concepts/skills/definition): Define skills, parameters and handlers.

## Example

We can add a section called `Response Scenarios` which is used to train the agent.

```tsx [src/prompt.ts]
// [!include ~/../../templates/ens/src/prompt.ts]
```
