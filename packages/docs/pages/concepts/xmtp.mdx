# XMTP

[XMTP](https://xmtp.org/) is the protocol that MessageKit uses to send and receive messages.

> Check out the [xmtp e2ee](https://docs-xmtp-org-git-agents-ephemerahq.vercel.app/agents/plugins) plugins for more information.

## Context

The `Context` object is a core component that provides access to all XMTP messaging functionality. It handles conversations, groups, and messages.

```tsx
import { Context } from "@xmtp/message-kit";

onMessage(async (context: Context) => {
  const {
    message, // Current message details
    client, // V3 XMTP client
    v2client, // V2 XMTP client
    conversation, // Current conversation
    group, // Group details if in a group chat
  } = context;

  // Your message handling logic
});
```

### Properties

#### Message

Contains information about the current message:

- `content`: The message content
- `sender`: Address of message sender
- `sent`: Timestamp when message was sent
- `typeId`: Type of message
- `client`: V3 XMTP client instance
- `v2client`: V2 XMTP client instance
- `conversation`: Current conversation object with messaging methods

#### Group (V3 Only)

Group chat information including:

- `members`: List of all group members
- `admins`: List of group administrators
- `superAdmins`: List of group super administrators

## Identity

Each messages comes with a sender object that contains the address, name, and avatar of the sender.

```tsx
interface Member {
  // Unique identifier for the user's inbox
  inboxId: string;

  // User's blockchain address (e.g. Ethereum address)
  address: string;

  // Array of all addresses associated with this identity
  accountAddresses: string[];

  // Array of unique installation identifiers
  installationIds: string[];
}

// Example usage
const { sender } = context.message;
```

### Properties:

- `inboxId`: A unique identifier for the user's message inbox. This remains consistent across different installations.
- `address`: The primary blockchain address associated with the sender. This is typically an Ethereum address.
- `accountAddresses`: An array of all blockchain addresses linked to this identity. Users can have multiple addresses associated with their XMTP identity.
- `installationIds`: Array of unique identifiers for each installation/device where the user has XMTP enabled.

## Clients

MessageKit provides wrapped versions of XMTP clients for easier integration:

```tsx
import { V2Client, V3Client } from "xmtp";
```

You can create new client instances using the `createClient` helper:

```tsx
import { XMTP } from "xmtp";

const xmtp = new XMTP();
const { v2client, v3client } = await xmtp.init();
```

## Availability

To check if a user has XMTP enabled:

```typescript
const { v2, v3 } = await context.xmtp.isOnXMTP(address);
```

Returns:

- `v2`: `true` if user has XMTP V2 enabled
- `v3`: `true` if user has XMTP V3 enabled
