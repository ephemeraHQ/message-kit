# Railway

## Introduction

Here’s how to easily deploy this app:

- Sign up at [Railway](https://railway.app/).
- Click 'New Project' and select 'Node.js'.
- Create a Redis DB or other (Optional)
- Connect your GitHub repository
- Set your environment variables
- Deploy your application.
- Register an [ENS domain](https://ens.domains/) and share your app!

## Deployment

1. **Sign Up and Setup**: Create an account at [Railway](https://railway.app/) and start a new empty project.

2. **Database (Optional)**: Optionally, right click to add a Redis database to your project.

- **Get the redis connection string**

Add the variable to the env editor in Railway.

```bash [.env]
KEY= # 0x... the private key of the bot wallet (with the 0x prefix)
REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING= # the connection string for the Redis database
```

3. **Repository**: Connect your GitHub repository where your app code resides and deploy the repo.

5. **Cache**:

:::warning
Installing a persistent cache is crucial for maintaining bot functionality and efficiency:
:::

- Preserves conversation history between deployments
- Prevents creation of new installations on each restart
- Ensures faster group additions by retaining past installations
- Avoids the 256-installation limit, preventing bot failure
- Reduces the risk of missing messages during redeployment

To implement:

- Use Railway's feature to attach a persistent volume to your container
- Set the database path to a location on this volume
- Ensure the `.cache` folder is stored on the persistent volume

This approach creates a continuous installation, preventing message loss and maintaining bot functionality across redeployments.
