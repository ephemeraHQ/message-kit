# Introduction

In this document, you'll learn about the structure and components of an agent project. We'll cover the following sections:

- **[Project files](#project-files)**: Understand the basic file structure of an agent project.
- **[Agent](#agent)**: Learn how to set up and run an agent using XMTP's message-kit.
- **[Context](#context)**: Learn how to access the context of the agent.
- **[Groups](#groups)**: Learn how to create and manage groups.
- **[Skills](#skills)**: Discover how to define the actions your agent can perform.
- **[Plugins](#plugins)**: Learn about plugins that can enhance the capabilities of your agent's skills.
- **[Vibes](#vibes)**: Understand how to define the personality and style of your agent.

## Project files

Each agent project consists of the following basic structure:

```bash
agent/
├── src/
│   └── index.ts
│   └── skills/
│       └── ...
├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json
└── .env
```

## Agent

This is the main function that runs the listener.

```jsx
// [!include ~/../../templates/simple/src/index.ts]
```

### Config

```tsx
config: {
  /* Optional properties */
}
```

- `encryptionKey`: the private key of the agent wallet, like any normal wallet private key.
- `experimental`: experimental features like logging all group messages. Default is `false`.
- `attachments`: to receive attachments. Default is `false`.
- `gptModel`: model to be used. Default is `gpt-4o`.
- `client`: Optional parameters to pass to the XMTP client.
- `agent`: Custom agent to be used. Default is to create the skills in the `src/skills.ts` file.
- `hideInitLogMessage`: hide the init log message with messagekit logo and stuff
- `memberChange`: if true, member changes will be enabled, like adding members to the group

## Context

The `Context` object is a core component that provides access to all XMTP messaging functionality. It handles conversations, groups, and messages.

```tsx
import { Context } from "@xmtp/message-kit";

onMessage(async (context: Context) => {
  const {
    message, // Current message details
    client, //  XMTP client
    conversation, // Current conversation
    group, // Group details if in a group chat
  } = context;

  // Your message handling logic
});
```

### Properties

Contains information about the current message:

- `content`: The message content
- `sender`: Address of message sender
- `sent`: Timestamp when message was sent
- `typeId`: Type of message
- `client`: XMTP client instance
- `conversation`: Current conversation object with messaging methods

## Groups

MessageKit allows agents to interact inside XMTP groups. Make sure you follow the guidelines for building responsible group agents on XMTP.

:::info
You need to **add the agent to the group as a member**.
:::

## Tag an agent

When a message includes a tag like `@bot`, it will be received by your agent.

```tsx
export const agent: Agent = {
  name: "Web3 Domain Bot",
  tag: "@bot",
  /* Your agent definition */
};
```

Example:

```bash
@bot who owns vitalik.eth
```

## Skills

Skills are the actions that the agent can perform. They are defined in the `src/skills/your-skill.ts` file.

```tsx
import { Skill } from "@xmtp/message-kit";

export const skills: Skill[] = [
  {
    skill: // name of the skill
    handler: handler(context)
    examples: // examples of the skill
    description: // description of the skill
    params: // params of the skill
  },
];
```

Learn more about skills in the [Skills](/framework/skills) section.

## Plugins

Plugins are the plugins that the Skills can use. They are defined in the `plugins/your-plugin.ts` file.

```tsx
import { createClient } from "@redis/client";
import type { RedisClientType } from "@redis/client";

export const getRedisClient = async () => {
  const client = createClient({
    url: process.env.REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING,
  });

  client.on("error", (err) => {
    console.error("Redis client error:", err);
  });

  await client.connect();
  return client as RedisClientType;
};
```

See [Plugins](/community/plugins) for more information.

## Vibes

Vibes are the personalities of the agent. They are defined in the `src/vibes/your-vibe.ts` file.

```tsx
import { Vibe } from "@xmtp/message-kit";

export const chill: Vibe = {
  vibe: // name of the vibe
  description: // description of the vibe
  tone: // tone of the vibe
  style: // style of the vibe
};
```
