# Installation

MessageKit is a powerful framework that simplifies the process of building messaging bots on [xmtp](https://docs.xmtp.org). Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started.

::::steps

### CLI

This tool simplifies the creation and configuration of new apps.

:::code-group

```bash [bun]
bun create message-kit
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create message-kit
```

```bash [npm]
npx init message-kit@latest
```

:::

_Refer to [structure](/concepts/structure) of the app so see the folder is created._

### Example

Start with a simple app that replies with `gm`.

```tsx [src/index.ts]
run(async (context: HandlerContext) => {
  // Get the message and the address from the sender
  const { content, sender } = context.message;

  // To reply, just call `reply` on the HandlerContext.
  await context.send(`gm`);
});
```

_You can also pick one of the 2 full [examples](#examples) available._

### Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project

```bash [cmd]
KEY= # 0x... the private key of the bot wallet (with the 0x prefix)
```

### Run the bot

Follow the steps below to run the bot

:::code-group

```bash [yarn]
# Install the dependencies
yarn install
# Run the app
yarn dev
```

```bash [bun]
# Install the dependencies
bun install
# run the app
bun dev
```

```bash [npm]
# Install the dependencies
npx init message-kit@latest
# Run the app

```
