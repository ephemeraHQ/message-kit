# Agent Wallets

The `WalletService` class in MessageKit provides a way to create agent wallets that can perform gasless payments and transfers on Base.

## Introduction

To use the `WalletService`, you need to initialize it with Coinbase API credentials:

### Requirements

- `@coinbase/coinbase-sdk`: Already included in MessageKit
- `@coinbase/cbpay-js`: Already included in MessageKit

- Environment variables:
  - `COINBASE_APP_ID`: The Coinbase app id
  - `COINBASE_API_KEY_NAME`: The Coinbase API key name
  - `COINBASE_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY`: The Coinbase API private key

## Wallet Management

The `getWallet` method will retrieve an existing wallet or create a new one if it doesn't exist:

```ts twoslash
import { run, XMTPContext, Agent } from "@xmtp/message-kit";
const level = "Danger";
const humanAddress = "0x1234567890";
const agent: Agent = {
  name: "Agent",
  description: "Agent",
  tag: "@Bots",
  skills: [],
  onMessage: async (context: XMTPContext) => {
    // ---cut---
// Get the wallet service
const { walletService } = context;

// Get or create a wallet
const wallet = await walletService.getWallet(humanAddress);

// Explicitly create a new wallet
const isCreated = await walletService.createWallet(humanAddress);

// Delete a wallet
await walletService.deleteWallet(humanAddress);


// ---cut-after---
  },
};

run(agent);
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### Actions

Perform actions on the Agent Wallet like transfers and swaps or checking the balance.

```ts twoslash
import { run, XMTPContext, Agent } from "@xmtp/message-kit";
const level = "Danger";
const humanAddress = "0x1234567890";
const amount = 100;
const fromhumanAddress = "0x1234567890";
const tohumanAddress = "0x1234567890";
const fromAssetId = "USDC";
const toAssetId = "ETH";
const agent: Agent = {
  name: "Agent",
  description: "Agent",
  tag: "@Bots",
  skills: [],
  onMessage: async (context: XMTPContext) => {
// ---cut---
// Get the wallet service
const { walletService } = context;

// Check balance
const {address, balance} = await walletService.checkBalance(humanAddress);

// Withdraw funds (optional amount parameter)
await walletService.withdrawFunds(amount);

// Transfer between wallets
await walletService.transfer(humanAddress, humanAddress, amount);

// Swap assets
await walletService.swap(humanAddress, fromAssetId, toAssetId, amount);
// ---cut-after---
  },
};

run(agent);
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

## Security Architecture

The WalletService uses encryption with local file storage:

- Wallets are encrypted using the groupId as the encryption key
- Only people
- Data is stored locally in `.data/wallet-storage` directory

## Code

This code is included in MessageKit, but you can import it directly in your files for more customization.

```tsx [src/plugins/cdp.ts]
// [!include ~/../../packages/message-kit/src/plugins/cdp.ts]
```
