# Resolver

Message Kit provides powerful username resolution capabilities through its resolver system. This allows applications to handle various types of identifiers including ENS domain and Converse usernames.

> Is already included in [MessageKit](/concepts/usernames)

## Caching

The resolver implements automatic caching to improve performance and reduce API calls. You can manage the cache using:

```typescript
// Clear cache for specific address
clearInfoCache(address);
// Clear entire cache
clearInfoCache();
```

## Code

This code is included in MessageKit, but you can import it directly in your files for more customization.

```tsx [src/helpers/resolver.ts]
// [!include ~/../../packages/message-kit/src/helpers/resolver.ts]
```
