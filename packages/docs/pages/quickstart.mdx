MessageKit is a powerful framework that simplifies the process of building messaging agents on [xmtp](https://docs.xmtp.org). Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to get you started.

### CLI

This tool simplifies the creation and configuration of new apps.

:::code-group

```bash [bun]
bun create message-kit
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create message-kit
```

```bash [npx]
npx create-message-kit
```

```bash [npm]
npm init message-kit
```

_Refer to [structure](/concepts/structure) of the app so see the folder is created._

### Templates

Start with a simple app that replies with `gm`.

```tsx [src/index.ts]
run(async (context: XMTPContext) => {
  // Get the message and the address from the sender
  const { content, sender } = context.message;

  // To reply, just call `reply` on the XMTPContext.
  await context.send(`gm`);
});
```

### Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project

```bash [cmd]
KEY= # the private key of the agent wallet
```
