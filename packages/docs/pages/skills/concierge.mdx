The Wallet Concierge acts as a personal financial assistant within your Agent. It handles the user financial needs without you needing to worry about the logic.

## Features

### Balance

Simply ask the concierge to check your balance, and it will provide you with the current amount in your wallet. For example, you can say:

```plaintext
Hey, check my balance.
```

The concierge will respond with your current balance.

```typescript
// Balance checking implementation
if (skill === "balance") {
  const { balance } = await walletService.checkBalance(sender.address);
  await context.send(`Your agent wallet has a balance of $${balance}`);
}
```

### Funding

You can request to add funds to your wallet. If you try to exceed the maximum limit, the concierge will notify you. For instance, you might say:

```plaintext
Can you add 5 USDC to my wallet?
```

The concierge will handle the transaction.

```typescript
// Funding logic
async function fund(context: Context, amount: number) {
  if (Number(balance) === 10) {
    await context.dm("You have maxed out your funds. Max 10 USDC.");
    return false;
  }

  let onRampURL = await walletService.onRampURL(
    amount,
    walletData.agent_address,
  );
  const url = await baselinks.requestPayment(
    walletData.agent_address,
    amount,
    "USDC",
    onRamp ? onRampURL : undefined,
  );
  await context.send(url);
}
```

### Transfers

You can instruct the concierge to transfer funds to another user. If your balance is insufficient, it will inform you. For example, you might say:

```plaintext
Please send 5 USDC to @username.
```

The concierge will execute the transfer.

```typescript
// Transfer implementation
if (skill === "transfer") {
  const { balance } = await walletService.checkBalance(sender.address);
  if (balance === 0) {
    await context.reply("You have no funds to transfer.");
    return;
  }

  await context.send(
    `Transferring ${amount} USDC to ${recipient?.preferredName}`,
  );
  const tx = await walletService.transfer(
    sender.address,
    recipient?.address as string,
    amount,
  );
}
```

### Swaps

You can instruct the concierge to swap tokens from one type to another. For example, you might say:

```plaintext
Please swap 0.1 ETH to USDC.
```

The concierge will execute the swap.

```typescript
// Swap implementation
if (skill === "swap") {
  await walletService.swap(sender.address, fromToken, toToken, amount);
  await context.send("Swap completed");
  return;
}
```

### Notifications

After a transaction, the concierge will notify you with a receipt and update your balance. It will also inform the recipient if they are on XMTP. For example, after sending funds, you will receive a message confirming the transaction and your new balance.

```typescript
// Smart notifications
await notifyUser(context, sender.address, recipient?.address, tx, amount);
```
