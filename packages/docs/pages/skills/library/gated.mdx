# Gated group

How to create a gated group chat through an admin agent.

## Create the group

Send this message to the bot to kickstart the creation of the group.

```bash
create group
```

The bot will create a private group where you and the bot are the admins.Then will provide some information like:

```bash
Group created!
- ID: {groupId}
- Group Frame URL: https://converse.xyz/group/{groupId}:
- This url will deelink to the group inside Converse
- Once in the other group you can share the invite with your friends.
```

## Endpoint

Once you start the server on your port `3000` by default you can ping this endpoint with the parameters

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/add-wallet \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"walletAddress": "0x7E0b0363404751346930AF92C80D1fef932Cc48a", "groupId": "2bc1d20d2e7ac190bcaff3bba0f012b3"}'
```

## Logic

```tsx [src/skills/gated.ts]
// [!include ~/../../templates/experimental/src/skills/gated.ts]
```
