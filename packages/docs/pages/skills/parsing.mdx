# Parsing

Parsing enables your agent to understand human-like requests and translate them into precise skill with defined parameters that can be used by the handler.

## Overview

For parsing to be effective we need to combine the following skills:

- [Definition](/skills/definition): Define skills, parameters and handlers.

## Example

Imagine your users chatting with your agent as naturally as texting a friend.

:::steps

### User request

```bash
/check vitalik.eth
```

### Parsing

This is the parameters extracted from the user request:

```json
{
  "skill": "check",
  "params": {
    "domain": "vitalik.eth"
  }
}
```

### Handler

```tsx
export async function handleEns(
  context: XMTPContext,
): Promise<SkillResponse | undefined> {
  const {
    message: {
      sender,
      content: { skill, params },
    },
  } = context;

  if (skill == "check") {
    const { domain } = params;
    const data = await getUserInfo(domain);
    if (!data?.address) {
      let message = `Looks like ${domain} is available! Here you can register it: ${ensUrl}${domain} or would you like to see some cool alternatives?`;
      return {
        code: 200,
        message,
      };
    } else {
      let message = `Looks like ${domain} is already registered!`;
      await context.executeSkill("/cool " + domain);
      return {
        code: 404,
        message,
      };
    }
  }
}
```
