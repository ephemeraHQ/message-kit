# Parsing

Parsing enables your agent to understand human-like requests and translate them into precise skill with defined parameters that can be used by the handler.

## Overview

For parsing to be effective we need to combine the following skills:

- [Definition](/skills/definition): Define skills, parameters and handlers.

## Example

Imagine your users chatting with your agent as naturally as texting a friend.

:::steps

### User request

```bash
/check vitalik.eth
```

### Parsing

This is the parameters extracted from the user request:

```json
{
  "skill": "check",
  "params": {
    "domain": "vitalik.eth"
  }
}
```

### Handler

The handler function to process check skill requests:

```tsx [src/handlers/check.ts]
// [!include ~/../../templates/agent/src/handlers/check.ts:handle]
```
