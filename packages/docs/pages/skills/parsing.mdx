# Parsing

Parsing enables your agent to understand human-like requests and translate them into precise skill with defined parameters that can be used by the handler.

## Overview

For parsing to be effective we need to combine the following skills:

- [Definition](/skills/definition): Define skills, parameters and handlers.

## Example

Imagine your users chatting with your agent as naturally as texting a friend.

:::steps

### User request

```bash
/check vitalik.eth
```

### Parsing

This is the parameters extracted from the user request:

```json
{
  "skill": "check",
  "params": {
    "domain": "vitalik.eth"
  }
}
```

### Handler

```tsx
import { ensUrl } from "../skills.js";
import { XMTPContext, getUserInfo } from "@xmtp/message-kit";

export async function handleCheck(context: XMTPContext) {
  const {
    message: {
      content: {
        params: { domain },
      },
    },
  } = context;

  const data = await getUserInfo(domain);
  if (!data?.address) {
    let message = `Looks like ${domain} is available! Here you can register it: ${ensUrl}${domain} or would you like to see some cool alternatives?`;
    return {
      code: 200,
      message,
    };
  } else {
    let message = `Looks like ${domain} is already registered!`;
    await context.executeSkill("/cool " + domain);
    return {
      code: 404,
      message,
    };
  }
}
```
