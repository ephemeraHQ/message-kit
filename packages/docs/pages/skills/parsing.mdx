# Parsing

Parsing enables your agent to understand human-like requests and translate them into precise skill with defined parameters that can be used by the handler.

## Overview

- [Definition](/skills/definition): Define skills, parameters and handlers.

## Example

Imagine your users chatting with your agent as naturally as texting a friend.

:::steps

### Parsed request

```bash
/check vitalik.eth
```

### Handler

The handler function to process check skill requests:

```tsx [src/skills/check.ts]
// [!include ~/../../templates/agent/src/skills/check.ts:handle]
```
