# Processing

Agent can respond with multiple messages, each separated by newlines. This allows for a structured approach a more natural conversation flow.

## Overview

For processing to be effective we need to combine the following skills:

- [Parsing](/skills/parsing): Interpret user intent and translate it into a defined skill.
- [Definition](/skills/definition): Define skills, parameters and handlers.

## Example

:::steps

### User request

```
I want to check if vitalik.eth is available
```

### Parsing

The agent will parse the response into an array of skills and messages. This happens in the `processMultilineResponse` function.

```tsx [gpt.ts]
["Let me check that domain for you", "/check vitalik.eth"];
```

### Execution

The agent will execute each skill in the array.

```tsx [index.ts]
// [!include ~/../../packages/message-kit/src/helpers/gpt.ts:processing]
```
