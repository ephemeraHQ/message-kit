# Processing new lines

Agent can respond with multiple messages, each separated by newlines. This allows for a structured approach a more natural conversation flow.

## Prompt

In the prompt you will find this multi line references:

```plaintext [prompt.ts]
- You can respond with multiple messages if needed. Each message should be separated by a newline character.
- You can trigger skills by only sending the skill in a newline message.
- Never announce actions without using a skill separated by a newline character.
- Don't answer in markdown format, just answer in plaintext.
```

## Example

:::steps

### User request

```
I want to check if vitalik.eth is available
```

### Bot reply

The bot will reply in full with text and different skills it can execute

```
Hey! Sure, Let me check that domain for you

/check vitalik.eth
```

### Parsing new lines

This happens in the `processMultilineResponse` function in the [GPT middleware](/middlewares/gpt.mdx), which takes the AI's response, splits it into individual messages, and handles each one appropriately:

```tsx [gpt.ts]
// Split response into separate messages and filter out empty lines
let messages = reply
  .split("\n")
  .map((message) => parseMarkdown(message))
  .filter((message) => message.length > 0);
```

This will return an array of messages, and then it will process each one sequentially:

```tsx [gpt.ts]
[" Let me check that domain for you", "/check vitalik.eth"];
```

### Putting it all together

```tsx [gpt.ts]
// Process each message sequentially
for (const message of messages) {
  if (message.startsWith("/")) {
    const response = await context.executeSkill(message);
    if (response && typeof response.message === "string") {
      let msg = parseMarkdown(response.message);
      chatMemory.addEntry(address, {
        role: "system",
        content: msg,
      });
      await context.send(response.message);
    } else {
      /* Other type of response in .data probably, or error */
    }
  } else {
    await context.send(message);
  }
}
```

The handler in this case returns all with `SkillResponse` type:

```tsx [processMultilineResponse.ts]
export type SkillResponse = {
  code: number;
  message: string;
  data?: {} | undefined;
};
```
