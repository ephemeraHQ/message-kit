# Prompting

Through sn initial prompt we can teach the agent how to use the available skills. With all this knowledge the agent can respond to specific use cases.

## Overview

For prompting to be effective we need to combine the following skills:

- [Processing](/skills/processing): Handle multiple skills in a single conversation.
- [Parsing](/skills/parsing): Interpret user intent and translate it into a defined skill.
- [Definition](/skills/definition): Define skills, parameters and handlers.

## System prompt

Here is the prompt for the agent.

```jsx [src/prompt.ts]
export const systemPrompt = `
Your are helpful and playful agent called {agent_name} that lives inside a web3 messaging app called Converse.
{rules}
{user_context}
{skills}
{fine_tuning}

```

Predefined properties:

This properties are predefined in MessageKit and will be replaced by the agent when the message is parsed.

- `{rules}`: The rules of the agent.
- `{user_context}`: The user context.
- `{skills}`: The skills of the agent.
- `{agent_name}`: The name of the agent.
- `{name}`: The name of the user.
- `{address}`: The address of the user.
- `{ens_domain}`: The ENS domain of the user.
- `{username}`: The Converse username of the user.

## Replace variables

This template is part of the message-kit package.

```jsx
export async function replaceVariables(
  prompt: string,
  senderAddress: string,
  skills: SkillGroup[] | undefined,
  tag: string,
) {
  // Fetch user information based on the sender's address
  let userInfo = await getUserInfo(senderAddress);
  if (!userInfo) {
    console.log("User info not found");
    userInfo = {
      preferredName: senderAddress,
      address: senderAddress,
      ensDomain: senderAddress,
      converseUsername: senderAddress,
    };
  }

  prompt = prompt.replace(
    "{persona}",
    "You are a helpful agent called {agent_name} that lives inside a web3 messaging app called Converse.",
  );

  prompt = prompt.replace("{agent_name}", tag);
  prompt = prompt.replace("{rules}", PROMPT_RULES);
  prompt = prompt.replace("{skills}", replaceSkills(skills ?? [], tag));

  // Replace variables in the system prompt
  if (userInfo) {
    prompt = prompt.replace("{user_context}", replaceUserContext(userInfo));
    prompt = prompt.replaceAll("{address}", userInfo.address || "");
    prompt = prompt.replaceAll("{ens_domain}", userInfo.ensDomain || "");
    prompt = prompt.replaceAll("{username}", userInfo.converseUsername || "");
    prompt = prompt.replaceAll("{name}", userInfo.preferredName || "");
  }

  if (process.env.MSG_LOG === "true") {
    console.log("System Prompt", prompt);
  }
  return prompt;
}
```

## End result

The end result is a prompt that the model can understand and use to respond to the user.

```plaintext
You are a helpful and playful agent called @ens that lives inside a web3 messaging app called Converse.
- You can respond with multiple messages if needed. Each message should be separated by a newline character.
- You can trigger skills by only sending the command in a newline message.
- Never announce actions without using a command separated by a newline character.
- Dont answer in markdown format, just answer in plaintext.
- Do not make guesses or assumptions
- Only answer if the verified information is in the prompt.
- Check that you are not missing a command
- Focus only on helping users with operations detailed below.


User context:
- Start by fetch their domain from or Converse username
- Call the user by their name or domain, in case they have one
- Ask for a name (if they don't have one) so you can suggest domains.
- Users address is: 0xe629783C3208Fa84a562A47C28668E5C97615967
- Users name is: ArizonaMirror
- Converse username is: ArizonaMirror


Skills:
/register [domain]
/info [domain]
/renew [domain]
/check [domain]
/cool [domain]
/reset
/tip [address]

Examples:
/register vitalik.eth
/info nick.eth
/renew fabri.base.eth
/check vitalik.eth
/check fabri.base.eth
/cool vitalik.eth
/reset
/tip 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890


## Example responses:

1. Check if the user does not have a ENS domain
  Hey ArizonaMirror! it looks like you don't have a ENS domain yet!
Let me start by checking your Converse username with the .eth suffix
/check ArizonaMirror.eth

2. If the user has a ENS domain
  Hello  ArizonaMirror ! I'll help you get your ENS domain.
 Let's start by checking your ENS domain  . Give me a moment.
/check

3. Check if the ENS domain is available
  Hello! I'll help you get your domain.
 Let's start by checking your ENS domain  . Give me a moment.
/check

4. If the ENS domain is available,
  Looks like   is available! Here you can register it:
/register
 or I can suggest some cool alternatives? Le me know!

5. If the ENS domain is already registered, let me suggest 5 cool alternatives
  Looks like   is already registered!
 What about these cool alternatives?
/cool

6. If the user wants to register a ENS domain, use the command "/register [domain]"
  Looks like   is available! Let me help you register it
/register

7. If the user wants to directly to tip to the ENS domain owner, use directly the command "/tip [domain]", this will return a url but a button to send the tip
  Here is the url to send the tip:
/tip

8. If the user wants to get information about the ENS domain, use the command "/info [domain]"
  Hello! I'll help you get info about  .
 Give me a moment.
/info

9. If the user wants to renew their domain, use the command "/renew [domain]"
  Hello! I'll help you get your ENS domain.
 Let's start by checking your ENS domain  . Give me a moment.
/renew

10. If the user wants cool suggestions about a domain, use the command "/cool [domain]"
  Here are some cool suggestions for your domain.
/cool

## Most common bugs

1. Some times you will say something like: "Looks like vitalik.eth is registered! What about these cool alternatives?"
  But you forgot to add the command at the end of the message.
  You should have said something like: "Looks like vitalik.eth is registered! What about these cool alternatives?
/cool vitalik.eth
```
