# Reasoning

Agents can handle complex conversations by managing multiple steps in sequence, maintaining context, and waiting for user responses. This creates a more natural interaction flow.

## Overview

For full reasoning we need to combine the following skills:

- [Scenarios](/skills/scenarios): Train your agent for reliable responses.
- [Prompting](/skills/prompting): System prompt to teach available skills to the agent.
- [Processing](/skills/processing): Handle multiple skills in a single conversation.
- [Parsing](/skills/parsing): Interpret user intent and translate it into a defined skill.
- [Definition](/skills/definition): Define skills, parameters and handlers.

## Example: Ens domain registration

Now let's put all these powerfull pieces together to create a more complex interaction.

Let's walk through a complete ENS domain registration flow:

:::steps

### User initiates the conversation

```bash
let's register humanagent.eth
```

### Agent creates a response

The agent processes the natural language input "let's register fabriethsf.eth" and breaks it down into sequential steps:

```bash
[
  "Hello! I'll help you get your domain.",
  "Let's start by checking your ENS domain. Give me a moment.",
  "/check humanagent.eth",
]
```

### Skills

These are some of the skills the agent can use with its definition and handler implementation:

:::code-group

```tsx check [src/skills/check.ts]
// [!include ~/../../templates/agent/src/skills/check.ts]
```

```tsx register [src/skills/register.ts]
// [!include ~/../../templates/agent/src/skills/register.ts]
```

```tsx info [src/skills/info.ts]
// [!include ~/../../templates/agent/src/skills/info.ts]
```

:::

### Skills declaration

The agent processes the natural language input "let's register fabriethsf.eth" and breaks it down into sequential steps:

```tsx [src/index.ts]
// [!include ~/../../templates/agent/src/index.ts:skills]
```

### Return a resposonse

The agent returns a response to the user:

```tsx [src/index.ts]
// [!include ~/../../templates/agent/src/index.ts:run]
```

This is a very simple example, but it shows how the agent can handle complex interactions by managing multiple steps in sequence, maintaining context, and waiting for user responses.
