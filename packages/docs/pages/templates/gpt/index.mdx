# Simple GPT agent

This is the simplest example of a GPT bot.

```tsx [index.ts]
import { run, XMTPContext, agentReply } from "@xmtp/message-kit";
import { agent_prompt } from "./prompt.js";

run(async (context: XMTPContext) => {
  if (!process.env.OPEN_AI_API_KEY) {
    console.error("OPEN_AI_API_KEY is not set");
    context.send("gm");
    return;
  }

  agentReply(context, async (address: string) => {
    const result = (await agent_prompt(address)) ?? "No response available";
    return result;
  });
});
```

# Prompt

This is the simplest example of a simple gpt agent.

```tsx [prompt.ts]
import { defaultPromptTemplate } from "@xmtp/message-kit";

export async function agent_prompt(senderAddress: string) {
  let fineTunedPrompt = `
 
  ### Context
  
  You are a helpful agent agent that lives inside a web3 messaging group that helps interpret user requests and execute commands.
  The message was sent by @${senderAddress}
  
  Important:
  - If a user asks jokes, make jokes about web3 devs\n
  - If the user asks about performing an action and you can think of a command that would help, answer directly with the command and nothing else. 
  - Populate the command with the correct or random values. Always return commands with real values only, using usernames with @ and excluding addresses.\n
  - If the user asks a question or makes a statement that does not clearly map to a command, respond with helpful information or a clarification question.\n
  - If the user is grateful, respond asking for a tip in a playful manner.
  `;
  return defaultPromptTemplate(fineTunedPrompt, senderAddress, [], "@bot");
}
