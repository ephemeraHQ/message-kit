# Group chat

This is a reference app that will allow you to understand the potential and all of its features. Through many handlers, you will be able to understand different use cases:

## Skills

- [Tipping](/templates/group/tipping): Tip when a user replies with `/tip`.
- [Games](/templates/group/games): Handle frame games like `/game slot`, `/game wordle`
- [Payments](/templates/group/pay): Handle skills like `/pay`
- [Helpers](/templates/group/helpers): Handle group helpers like `/id`, `/help`
