# Payments

This example demonstrates how to generate frame URLs for different types of payments.

```bash [cmd]
/pay 1 usdc to @bo
```

## Skill declaration

How the skill is declared in the `skills.ts` file:

```tsx [src/skills.ts]
import { handler as transaction } from "./handler/transaction.js";
export const skills: SkillGroup[] = [
  {
    name: "Group bot",
    tag: "@bot",
    description: "Group agent for tipping payments, games and more.",
    skills: [
      /* Other skills */
      {
        skill: "/pay [amount] [token] [username]",
        examples: ["/pay 10 vitalik.eth"],
        description:
          "Send a specified amount of a cryptocurrency to a destination address.",
        handler: payment,
        params: {
          amount: {
            default: 10,
            type: "number",
          },
          token: {
            default: "usdc",
            type: "string",
            values: ["eth", "dai", "usdc", "degen"], // Accepted tokens
          },
          username: {
            default: "",
            type: "username",
          },
        },
      },

      /* Other skills */
    ],
  },
];
```

## Handler

The handler function to process payment-related skill requests:

```tsx [src/handlers/payment.ts]
// [!include ~/../../templates/group/src/handlers/payment.ts]
```
