# Skills

Skills are the main logic of the agent. They are responsible for handling the user's input and generating responses.

```tsx [src/skills.ts]
import { handler as tipping } from "./handler/tipping.js";
import { handler as payment } from "./handler/payment.js";
import { handler as games } from "./handler/game.js";
import { handler as help } from "./handler/helpers.js";
import type { SkillGroup } from "@xmtp/message-kit";

export const skills: SkillGroup[] = [
  {
    name: "Group bot",
    tag: "@bot",
    description: "Group agent for tipping and transactions.",
    skills: [
      /* declarations */
    ],
  },
];
```
