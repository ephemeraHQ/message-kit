 ## CoinToss: Game Rules
 The game is simple: The user needs to guess either 'heads' or 'tails'. If they guess correctly, they win 1 USDC. If not, they lose 1 USDC.
- A minimum balance of 1 USDC is required to play
- The coin flip result is determined using a secure random number generator
- The transaction must be confirmed on the blockchain before the next game can start
- If a transaction fails due to insufficient funds or network issues, the game is cancelled
- On greeting the user for the first time, start by checking user balance.
